CONFIDENT IN THE MOMENT:
Improve Your Spontaneous
Speaking by Attacking Anxiety
at Its Roots
Award-winning journalist Joan Lunden is one of American media’s most
recognizable and affable personalities. As co-host of ABC News’
popular program Good Morning America during the 1980s and 90s, she was
a friendly, approachable figure known by millions for her willingness to get
personal and reveal aspects of her private life to her audience. And yet,
as Lunden told me, she did her best to hide a surprising secret: She was
terrified of speaking in public.
How could a person who often operated without a script before a
national audience feel nervous public speaking? As Lunden explains, speak-
ing in a studio and engaging with people in live settings felt very different to
her. In a studio, she was just talking to a camera. When she was out in front
of audiences, she was much more aware of performing in front of strangers
who might have been judging her. “You’re seeing people’s faces,” she says,
“and you’re seeing them watching you, eyeball to eyeball, and reacting.”1
Formal speeches were hard enough, but speaking spontaneously at
informal gatherings was even harder—Lunden couldn’t just hide behind
a podium and read a pre-prepared speech word for word. As she mingled
with strangers, she had to think of something to say in the moment, an
experience that triggered feelings of self-doubt and concern. “There’s this
little niggly thing at the back of your brain that says, “Do I really have
anything important to say? How am I going to come off? What are they
going to think of me?”
2
Many of us share Lunden’s fear of spontaneous speaking. We don’t feel
engaged or included when put on the spot—we feel put on the defensive.
When an audience member in a public setting unexpectedly offers an
opinion and asks us to react to it, it can feel as if they’re challenging our
credibility. When our boss asks us what we think in a meeting, or when
we must think on our feet and remedy a technical snafu on Zoom, our
competence can seem at issue. When we must offer someone a spontaneous
tribute, we can feel as if we must prove our charm, charisma, and devotion
to the person in question.
Worse still, the anxiety we feel about communicating in impromptu
situations can take on a life of its own, making it increasingly more difficult
to respond well. I hear many stories of people who struggle because of
their challenges with spontaneous communication. They get passed up for
promotions and job opportunities. They fail to land a first date (or a sec-
ond). They find it tough to connect with their kids or to handle unexpected
parenting challenges. They can’t seem to make new friends. As these failures
pile up, their anxiety mounts and their confidence sinks, causing them to
retreat inward and avoid pursuing opportunities in the first place. Their
lives become more difficult and less fulfilling than they might otherwise have
been—all because they’re locked into a belief that they’re innately bad at
communicating spontaneously, and because they find it awkward to speak
well on the fly.
If you feel anxious at the prospect of being put on the spot in social
settings, you should know that fear of speaking in front of others, whether
spontaneous or not, is normal and natural—part of our evolutionary
heritage. Back in prehistoric times when we lived in small tribes of people,
our relative status in the group was a matter of life and death. If we didn’t
make the tribe’s VIP list, so to speak, or if we weren’t even close, we’d
find ourselves near the back of the line when it came to distributing vital
resources like food, water, or shelter. We’d also be less likely to reproduce.
As a result, our ancestors developed an acute sensitivity toward social rank
as well as anxiety about anything that threatened their status. Since saying
or doing the wrong thing might compromise our ancestors’ social status
with severe, even fatal consequences, members of our species came to feel a
strong trepidation about speaking up.2
Messing up a job interview or some other instance of spontaneous
speaking probably won’t lead to our demise, but it doesn’t matter—our brains
are still wired for tribal living. For this reason, the mere prospect of being put
on the spot can thrust us headlong into fight-or-flight mode. If that happens
to us, we’re not somehow weak, incapable, or less-than. We’re human.
3
The good news is that we don’t have to remain imprisoned and stuck
because of our anxiety. We can learn to manage these emotions so that we
can respond more effectively in spontaneous situations and in time build up
our confidence. As I’ve found coaching students and executive clients, manag-
ing anxiety when speaking spontaneously requires a two-pronged approach:
handling the symptoms of anxiety, and addressing its underlying sources.
Addressing symptoms—a subject I cover in chapter 1 of Thinking Faster,
Talking Smarter—can help us feel more relaxed and comfortable because we
no longer fixate on or feel depleted by our anxious behaviors. Our audience,
too, can focus on what we’re saying and not be distracted by the anxiety
signals we’re sending. To truly bring our anxiety under control, however,
we also have to tackling the underlying factors that initiate, perpetuate, and
exacerbate our fears.
Watch out for EGO
Three of these factors are especially important and also readily
addressable. I call them EGO—Evaluation, Goal, and Operating approach.
Understanding these three can point us to an additional set of tools to help
us moderate anxiety.
One huge source of anxiety that I see all the time, and that Joan
Lunden was keenly aware of, is the notion that others are evaluating and judging
us. This, again, originates in our evolutionary history. During our prehistoric
days, when relative social status directly affected an individual’s ability to
survive, we were constantly trying to figure out where we ranked in others’
estimations, and we were constantly ranking others as well. The task of
judging and evaluating is as important today as it was at the dawning of our
species, part and parcel of being human.
By virtue of temperament or past experience, some of us are even more
attuned to this reality. We become extraordinarily self-conscious, wondering
how every last thing we say or do is registering with others, and glomming
on to the slightest sign that what we’re saying is offensive or somehow falling
flat. In both formal and informal settings, the feeling of being judged tends
to be worse when we’re just beginning our remarks (in fact, most people
report feeling most anxious in the first minute of their communication).3
If
we can get through that initial hump, our awareness of being judged tends
to dissipate because the threat lessens.
A second common source of anxiety around spontaneous communi-
cation is a concern over our goals. When we communicate, we often have
specific goals in mind. We might want to convince an attractive other to go
on a date with us. We might want a job or promotion. We might want to
notch a sale. We might want our project supported. Whatever our goal is,
4
many of us worry that we won’t achieve it, and this anxiety debilitates us.
Consider the goal of doing well on a test. Anxiety around test-taking
actually leads students to get worse grades at school. Speculating as to why,
researchers suggest that the stress produced by anxiety taxes the same parts
of our brains that we rely on when performing complex tasks. Anxiety also
causes us to ruminate, which saps up our working memory and prevents us
from applying it to the task at hand.4
Anxiety around the goal of responding well in spontaneous situations
might also hamper us cognitively. And as I’ve seen with my clients, it can
have other unfortunate effects. Some clients become so anxious thanks to
their desire to achieve a goal during an upcoming spontaneous speaking
situation that they have trouble sleeping the night before. When they show
up the next day at their big job interview, sales meeting, or romantic date,
they’re groggy and not able to think clearly. As a result, they don’t do as
well. Other clients get so nervous because of their goal of getting a job
offer, land a big sale, or impress a date that they wind up backing out of the
social encounter entirely—a sure way not to achieve their goal.
A third and final source of anxiety comes from unhelpful orientations
to speaking we might have that can ratchet up the pressure. Many of us
tend to think of our communication in the moment as a performance that
must be perfect. We’re “on stage,” and even a single mistake we might
make would be glaringly obvious. Sometimes we presume that impromptu
communication is adversarial—our audience is out to challenge or critique
us or to prove us wrong. We commonly go into job interviews or ques-
tion-and-answer sessions with this mindset. I’ll spend more time analyzing
these mindsets in Chapters 2 and 3 of Think Faster, Talk Smarter, but for now
let’s just notice them and the angst they can cause us. These mindsets cause
us to feel pressured and attacked. It’s no surprise that our fight-or-flight
response kicks in.
As these three sources of anxiety suggest, communication isn’t emotion-
ally neutral for most of us. Our egos and sense of self-worth strongly color
our experience of expressing ourselves before others. We care about what
others think of us. We care about our goals. And we care about doing our
best as communicators. To reduce anxiety, we must acknowledge that we’re
emotionally vested in our speaking and that it affects us in a fundamental
way. Then we must act to disentangle our egos from our speaking, recog-
nizing that they get in the way of truly being present with our audience. We
must find ways to dial down our ego involvement so we can increase our
connection. We still want to be emotionally invested in our content and care
about our relationship with our audiences, while not fixating on the results
of our communication.
5
Attacking Anxiety at Its Roots
Effective tools exist that help us put EGO in its place. To diminish
our sense that others are evaluating us, we can turn to three different
techniques. The first entails understanding the significant gap that exists
between our experience of our internal states such as anxiety and others’
perception of those states. As researchers have documented, others don’t
have nearly as good a read on our internal states as we think they do.
An “illusion of transparency” exists.5
To reduce how intensely and deeply
we perceive that others are judging us, we can make ourselves aware of
this gap.
Using your smart phone, record yourself responding to one of the
following three prompts: “Tell a story about a project you’re working on
at work.” “Tell a story about your name.” “Talk about a personal goal you
have that you want to achieve in the next year.” Keep your response short—
about one to two minutes. When you’re done, play your response back.
What do you notice? Did you make good eye contact? Were there lots of
ums? Did you gesture at all? Were you swaying and shifting? How nervous
did you feel? How nervous did you look? When my students perform this
exercise, they remark that they don’t look nearly as nervous as they felt.
Their sense of feeling judged dissipates, leaving them feeling calmer, more
confident, and in control.
A second way to address others’ evaluations of us is to practice the art
of distraction. If we can distract our audience and direct them away from
ourselves, we can open up a small bit of space for us to calm ourselves
down. Tactics include asking a provocative question, taking a quick, infor-
mal poll with a show of hands or a virtual reaction (more appropriate if
you’re speaking before a sizable group), showing others around you a video
or an image on your smart phone, and so on.
When I teach, I often ask students to take a minute to think about how
a point or argument we just covered might relate to them. Likewise, when
I’m in social settings and can’t remember what to say, I will comment on
something I perceive in the environment or invite someone else to enter
the conversation. These actions give me just a bit of a breather to get my
bearings and manage my anxiety. A client of mine starts all-hands meetings
at his company by showing a short video. Doing so implicitly puts him in
the role of a facilitator rather than presenter, a shift that in his mind takes
the pressure off of him to perform.

• • • TRY IT • • •
Think of two or three specific questions you might pose to your
audience to give yourself a bit of time to collect your thoughts.
Examples might include: “How might this idea impact your current
work?”; “How can you apply this information in your life?” “How does
this information change or reinforce your thoughts on this topic”? You
might also ask audience members what about a particular idea or
point seems most surprising or memorable to them. Selecting among
these or other questions, write them down on a notecard or enter
them into your phone. That way, you’ll have them available to you at
moments when you might be put on the spot.
Third, we can diminish our feeling of being judged by desensitizing
ourselves to it. In so-called exposure therapy, psychologists expose patients
to distressing situations in small doses so that over time they become habit-
uated and feel less distressed. Similarly, by deliberately putting ourselves in
situations where we know we’re being judged, such as asking a question in a
meeting, we can desensitize ourselves to the experience.
Imagine a politician practicing for a debate or a sales person preparing
to confront fear or uncertainty before making a pitch. We can also desen-
sitize ourselves through visualization—we can picture ourselves, say, in a
cocktail party being put on the spot and having those present look down
upon us after hearing how we responded. These days, we can use tech-
nology to expose ourselves in manageable doses to others’ judgment. One
virtual reality tool called Virtual Speech allows users to don goggles and
simulate speaking in front of audience of various sizes and that are engaged
to various extents in what users are saying.
We can also take steps to help reduce anxiety associated with concerns
about reaching our goals. Goals are all about the future. When we wonder
whether we’ll obtain our goals in a speaking situation, we’re drifting away
from the present moment and focusing on something that might happen at
some future time. A powerful corrective is simply to redirect our attention
purposefully back to the present. There are many ways to do this just before
we step into situations where we might have to communicate spontaneously.
We might perform a difficult mental task, like counting backwards from 100
by 17s. We might listen to music. We might do something physical.
I invite you to experiment with your own methods of redirecting your
attention back to the present. But be careful. One former student of mine
used to play Tetris to get focused before formal presentations. Sometimes
she got so engrossed that she forgot to show up for her big meetings!
She now sets a timer when she starts playing. Another person I know, a
7
former police officer, found that he could keep his mind from spiraling off
unhelpfully into the future by performing 100 pushups right before he went
on stage and took questions from his audience. You simply can’t do 100
pushups, keeping track of their number as you go, while focusing on your
future goals. The downside, of course, was that he got sweaty and flushed.
If you have only a small amount of advance warning before the
need to communicate (you’re sitting in a meeting about to be called on,
for instance), you can refocus yourself on the present by practicing deep
breathing. This is quite easy if you are virtual. Simply select your virtual
tool’s mute button to allow you to take an unnoticed deep breath or two.
Or perhaps you might call for a quick break and take a short walk before
returning. You could do something as simple as reaching out and touching
the desk in front of you with your hands—that can help to nudge your mind
back into the present. In just five or six seconds, you can rehearse a short
tongue twister. My favorite one, since you asked, is the following: “I slit a
sheet. A sheet I slit. And on that slitted sheet, I sit.” Try to say that quickly
without accidentally uttering a naughty word. The mere effort will cause
you to forget about your future-oriented goals and be present.
• • • TRY IT • • •
There’s nothing like a tongue-twister to focus you on the present and
prevent yourself from feeling anxious about future goals. Write down
a tongue twister and keep it handy for times when you suspect you
might have to speak on the fly.
I’ll say more about how to address unhelpful operating approaches in
Chapters 2 and 3 of Think Faster, Talk Smarter. For now, note that we can
moderate our anxiety levels by changing these mindsets. Instead of perceiv-
ing our communication as a performance that can and must be perfect, we
can think of it as a more informal conversation in which we can connect by
speaking authentically, not perfectly. Instead of viewing spontaneous com-
munication as a jousting contest in which audience are trying to critique us
or prove us wrong, we can frame it as an opportunity to convey our ideas to
an audience.

Let’s begin to reframe communication as an opportunity to expose
audiences to your ideas rather than to joust with them. Think of an

Examples Effects
1. Understand
the Gap
Make yourself more
aware of a key fact:
Although you might
feel that people are
noticing your anxiety,
it might not be as
discernible as you
think
You can diminish
your sense of being
judged, and hence
your anxiety
2. Ask a Provocative
Question
What do you think
of this cat video?
Who will win the next
election?
Your audience will no
longer be focused
on you
3. Exposure Therapy Expose yourself to
judgment—imagine
it, stimulate it using
virtual reality, post
something on social
media
Just like the prover-
bial toad submerged
in the gradually
warming water, this
mild exposure will

Working with Anxiety
Joan Lunden initially felt anxious when put on the spot, but she leaned
into her fears, attacking them at their roots using a number of techniques.
To reduce her sense of being judged in social situations, she practiced a
version of exposure therapy, pushing herself to lead informal Q&A sessions
as part of a series of appearances she made with the inspirational speaker
Tony Robbins. Those sessions were “probably the best thing I ever did,”
she reflects, “because I had no choice other than to be extemporaneous.
The more you do it, the more comfortable, less fearful, and more confident
you get.”
Lunden also started bringing herself into the present by borrowing a
practice from Robbins and doing physical exercises such as squats or sit-ups
before speaking appearances. “I have to tell you,” she said, “it works every
time. You go out there immensely more confident than if you don’t do it.
Anyone can do this before a PTA meeting, business meeting, dinner party—
anything.” To solidify both her confidence and groundedness in the present,
she would finish her pre-appearance routine by smiling into a bathroom
mirror. Doing so had the additional benefit of improving her mood if she
happened to be upset or angry about something.
Lunden further reduced her anxiety by shifting her mindset away from
perfectionism and a performance orientation, viewing impromptu speaking
appearances instead as potential learning opportunities. With the pressure
off, she could take any negative feedback she received in stride. To enhance
her learning, she also began to prepare in advance for spontaneous situa-
tions, researching the people with whom she’d be interacting and thinking
of some topics she might discuss or points she might raise in the moment.
This preparation allowed her to feel more confident in the moment and
also to offer up better responses. As she reflects, shifting her mindset about
spontaneous speaking was key: “We all have the ability to change our mood
and change our sense of ourself by changing what we say to ourself. You
can change a habit anytime you want to change a habit. Every habit is
changeable. And the same goes for your frame of mind.”
Change didn’t come easy for Lunden—she worked on her anxiety over a
period of years. Today, she is much more confident when entering any kind
of spontaneous speaking situation—and formal presentations as well. “I now
love to speak,” she says. “I know I’m good at it. I know I can entertain an
audience. I know I can command the stage.” She accepts a wide range of
speaking opportunities, including ones she never would have taken earlier in
her career. Attacking the sources of anxiety made all the difference.
Working with the techniques in this chapter, start chipping away at your
anxiety through consistent effort and practice. Change won’t happen right
10
away, but as I think you’ll find, sticking with it can yield enormous benefits
over time. Improving your ability to speak well in the moment can allow
you to ace that job interview, get that second date (or that first one), inspire
that team of yours to perform at its best, forge that exciting new friendship,
bring that community of people together. On a personal level, it can allow
you to overcome challenges you might have thought impossible, in the
process helping to build your confidence and self-esteem. It can help you
to seize opportunities, truly live your life to the fullest, and contribute your
ideas to the wider world.
All of us can become strong, confident speakers in the moment—we
don’t have to be extroverts born with the gift of gab. It starts with recogniz-
ing the underlying causes of the fears we feel and committing ourselves to
the ongoing work of addressing them. If we become more adept at tackling
anxiety at the source, we’re well on our way to thinking faster and talking
smarter.
